# Welcome to ShniyDex!
This application uses Remix and pokeAPI!

- [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs)
- [PokeAPI Docs](https://pokeapi.co/)

## Development
This application was made to test my react/typescript skills and I was able to learn a lot in this process.
The application displays multiple different data points about the Pokemon and allows them to see in a table format all of the shiny pokemon.


## Idea
Add buttons at the bottom of the page that will take the user to another page so they can look at the shiny pokemon of the gen generation they
want to look at.
